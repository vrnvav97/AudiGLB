GL Bajaj Audi Booking Web-App


Introduction:

The main objective of building this application was to bring in the concept of automation and to remove the paper
work involved in the traditional method of booking auditorium through manual work of management of bookings.
This idea came into the mind of two young students of the G. L. Bajaj namely Mukul Kumar and Varun
Agrawal (@vrnvav97) and it is their small contribution towards the development of college. This application was made keeping
in mind all the features and functions needed to efficiently manage an auditoriums booking.


Features of the system:

➢ User and Admin Login and Dashboard:
Though this application has the ability for user to request for booking but admin has the whole authority and
responsibility for approving and disapproving the user’s request. This application has given separate set of
services to both user and admin and some extra services to administrator keeping in mind their purpose.

➢ Allotment of the auditorium according to the number of attendees:
This application is focused on allotting the auditorium to user in the most effective and ecofriendly way
possible, so that it doesn’t harm the environment with the excessive usage of present inventions. This allowance
of auditorium depending on the number of gathering facility is totally dependent on administrator.

➢ Check previous bookings:
The system keeps track of auditorium status and advance bookings in a well-maintained database. Thus it
becomes easier for anyone to search any record and data for their future reference. The users of this application
can track all the information of booking dates and requests as per their requirement.

➢ Email Notification:
The system will inform the respective customers through an email about their status of booking request whether
approved or disapproved.

➢ Proper Validations:
The system is consisting of all the validations wherever needed and necessary. One such validation is limitation
on booking of auditorium on any previous data irrespective of present or future date, or, filling of all the details
in the well-set requesting form.

➢ Proper Serving and Tracking of requests:
Since the application is stored on server and its database is also stored on a remote server, therefore it is capable
of fulfilling any query at any time with the least possible latency time. Administrators can anytime track any
request and approve requests.

➢ User Oriented GUI:
The system is built with easy user navigations and user interfaces. Proper usage of colors and interactivity is
added wherever required. Proper Inclusion of photos of auditorium is also added for the reference of user.
